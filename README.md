# RisiKo-probabilities-calculator

This is a probabilities calculator that, given the armies size of the attacker and the defender, will calculate the **probability of winning the battle** and the **expected losses of the attacker** using _Markov chain_. At the end the _heatmap_ of the two computed values will be plotted.

Required libraries:
 - numpy
  - matplotlib
